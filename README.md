About
--------

Chutte.com is a reverse auction web app.
*[Reverse Auction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_auction)
Some technologies we used:
  * [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) for unidirectional data flow and performant UI
  * [Redux](https://github.com/rackt/redux) architecture for predictable app state, with [react-redux](https://github.com/rackt/react-redux) bindings
  * [react-router](https://github.com/rackt/react-router) and [redux-router](https://github.com/rackt/redux-router) for routing
  * [redux-devtools](https://github.com/gaearon/redux-devtools) for time travel debugging
  * [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) to transpile ES6/7 syntax
  * [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) for builds/automation, with [eslint](http://eslint.org/) linting and [mocha](https://mochajs.org/)/[chai](http://chaijs.com/) testing
  * [BootStrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) React components implementing BootStrap's Material Design
  * [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.org/) database with [Sequelize](http://docs.sequelizejs.com/en/latest/) ORM
  * [bcrypt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt-nodejs) for user authentication
  * [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/)/[Express](http://expressjs.com/en/index.html) server with [redux-thunk](https://github.com/gaearon/redux-thunk) middleware

Demo
----

Check out [chutte.com](http://www.chutte.com/). 
Also check out [our quick demo video](http://bit.ly/chutte).


Getting Started
---------------

Clone the repo and install the necessary node modules:

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/KGB-JS/chutte.git
$ cd fear-the-repo
$ npm install                   # Install Node modules listed in ./package.json (this will be a while)
```

Usage
-----

#### `npm run build`
Runs the webpack build system with webpack-dev-server (by default found at `localhost:3000`).

Using Redux DevTools
--------------------

In development, Redux Devtools are enabled by default. You can toggle visibility and move the dock around using the following keyboard shortcuts:

- <kbd>Ctrl+H</kbd> Toggle DevTools Dock
- <kbd>Ctrl+Q</kbd> Move Dock Position
- see [redux-devtools-dock-monitor](https://github.com/gaearon/redux-devtools-dock-monitor) for more detail information.

Webpack
-------

The webpack compiler configuration is located in `~/build/webpack`. Here you'll find configurations for each environment; `development`, `production`, and `development_hot`. These configurations are selected based on your current `NODE_ENV`, with the exception of `development_hot` which will _always_ be used by webpack dev server.

**Note**: There has been a conscious decision to keep development-specific configuration (such as hot-reloading) out of `.babelrc`. By doing this, it's possible to create cleaner development builds (such as for teams that have a `dev` -> `stage` -> `production` workflow) that don't, for example, constantly poll for HMR updates.

So why not just disable HMR? Well, as a further explanation, enabling `react-transform-hmr` in `.babelrc` but building the project without HMR enabled (think of running tests with `NODE_ENV=development` but without a dev server) causes errors to be thrown, so this decision also alleviates that issue.
